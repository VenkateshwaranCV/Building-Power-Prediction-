# 📊 Energy Consumption Analysis of uOttawa's FSS Building

This project explores weather and environmental data to analyze and model energy usage patterns in the FSS (Faculty of Social Sciences) building at the University of Ottawa.

## 🧪 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on meteorological and environmental variables.
- Preprocess and clean missing and outlier data for modeling readiness.
- Use supervised machine learning techniques to predict energy consumption levels.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Imbalanced-learn

## 📈 Methodology
- **EDA:** Visualized distributions, trends, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, removed outliers, normalized features.
- **Modeling:** Applied regression models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Validation:** Used cross-validation and residual plots to assess model behavior.
